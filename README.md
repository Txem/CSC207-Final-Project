## Summary of the Project's Purpose

The purpose of this project is to create a recipe organizer application that allows users to manage their recipes effectively, explore new recipes, and get recommendations based on their preferences and available ingredients. This project aims to provide an easy and accessible way for users to organize meal planning, discover new culinary ideas, and accommodate dietary needs. The goal is to solve the problem of keeping track of various recipes, managing meal types, and finding suitable recipes based on individual needs.


## Software Specification

The recipe organizer program should be capable of:

Allowing users to add, edit, and delete recipes.

Enabling users to categorize recipes by type (e.g., breakfast, lunch, dinner, dessert) and dietary preferences (e.g., vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free).

Providing a search function for users to find recipes by ingredients, recipe name, or category.

Allowing users to save favorite recipes for easy access.

Optionally suggesting recipes based on ingredients the user currently has available.

## User Stories:

Tim(Zhoquan) Liu: As a user, I need to log in into my account and create my own recipes. The recipe should contain a name, ingredients with ingredient names and quantity, and instructions. 
The application will store all recipes that I create.

User Story 2: As a user, I want to categorize my recipes by meal type and dietary preferences, so that I can easily find recipes that suit my needs or dietary restrictions.

User Story 3: As a user who doesnâ€™t have my own recipes, I want to explore more recipes based on the ingredients I currently have and my preferences. I want to get recommendations by providing some keywords.

User Story 4: As a user, I want to mark recipes as my favorites so I can easily access them later when planning meals.
